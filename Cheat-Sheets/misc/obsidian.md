#  Markdown format for internal links

Obsidian supports the following link formats:

- Wikilink: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
- Markdown: `[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)`

The examples above are equivalent—they appear the same way in the editor, and links to the same note.

By default, due to its more compact format, Obsidian generates links using the Wikilink format. If interoperability is important to you, you can disable Wikilinks and use Markdown links instead.

To use the Markdown format:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Under **Files & Links**, disable **Use `[[Wikilink]]`**.

Even if you disable the Wikilink format, you can still autocomplete links by typing two square brackets `[[`. When you select one of the suggested files, Obsidian instead generates a Markdown link.
