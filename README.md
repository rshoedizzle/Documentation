# Welcome to My Homelab

Iâ€™m Ryan, an aspiring tech enthusiast trying to learn about various applications, software and hardware from the comfort of my own home. My current goal in the realm of IT is creating my own homelab to learn new skills for my own career progression as well as for my own enjoyment and fun! 

Over time I continued to research about what a homelab is and what I could do with one. I never truly understood and still don't entirely understand what a homelab can entail but I figured it would be worth starting and learning along the way. Over time, I ended up with some spare PC parts that could be put together for the job. Since then I have been utilizing this hand-me-down parts as well as my first PC I bought to run my lab. 

The goal of this repository is to help guide myself and others through constant documentation. Some of it might prove helpful, others might be used for reference once in a while, regardless, it's all gonna be here! I am not the best at memorization, so I am attempting to learn more by constantly documenting to showcase what I have learned.

## My Content

- **[Documentation](https://github.com/rshoedizzle/Documentation):** Central documentation repository containing all the files for my quick reference guides, "how to" guides, and other system guides that I am learning.
	- **[Cheat-Sheets](https://github.com/rshoedizzle/Documentation/tree/main/Cheat%20Sheets):** Quick reference sheets to various applications and code snippets for various applications and software utilized in my homelab.
	- **[Enterprise Toolkit](https://github.com/rshoedizzle/Documentation/tree/main/Enterprise%20Toolkit):** Documentation for larger systems that I am taking notes on or learning. These are going to be more Enterprise focused.
	- **[Homelab Logs](https://github.com/rshoedizzle/Documentation/tree/main/Homelab%20Logs):** General guides pertaining to the building of my homelab whether hardware or software related.
- **[Blog Configuration](https://github.com/rshoedizzle/rshoedizzle.github.io):** Repository used in synchronization with GitHub Pages to host a blog website. Repository was forked from a Chirpy Jekyll theme and is used as the basis for my blog.

## In Progress

- Homelab Configs: Documents that are helpful throughout my homelab. Examples being docker-compose .yml files, configuration files, etc.
- Templates: Template files for various applications. Eventually to have Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible templates.
